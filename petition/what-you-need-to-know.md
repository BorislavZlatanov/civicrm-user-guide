What You Need To Know
=====================

The following concepts are important to understand before creating and
using petitions, and the key questions will help you to plan your
petition.

Key Concepts
------------

Petitions are a function within the CiviCampaign component of CiviCRM.
When an individual responds to a petition, an activity record of the
type Petition is created that contains the individual's responses to the
petition questions.

Petitions are essentially online surveys. 

### Petitions and campaigns

Petition is a feature of CiviCampaign; but a petition doesn't
necessarily have to be connected to a specific campaign. For example, if
the Toft Organisation For Tenants (TOFT) used a petition to assess
members' satisfaction with TOFT's web site, it probably would not need
to be connected to a campaign. But the petition described in the
scenario in the previous chapter is part of TOFT's Demand for Better
Housing campaign, which includes a survey and other activities.
Connecting the petition to the campaign enabled the organisation's staff
to analyse petition responses in the context of the other strategies and
activities in the campaign.

### Profiles and custom fields

Using petitions in CiviCRM requires setting up two profiles. One profile
is to capture basic contact information, including email address.
Capturing email addresses via petitions is necessary to validate and
accurately verify the submission and count signatures, especially since
you won't want to count multiple submissions from a single person. The
other profile contains custom activity fields that hold the responses to
the petition questions.

You will want prepare your questions and the standard responses, if any,
you want to gather before creating your custom field sets and custom
profiles.

To learn more about how to create custom field sets, see the chapter on
*Creating Custom Fields* in the section *Organising Your Data*. To learn how to
create a custom profile, see *Profiles* in the section *Organising your
Data*.

### Drupal Permissions

If you are using Drupal, you need to set permissions to allow specific
roles to Sign CiviCRM Petitions. Refer to the next chapter called Set-up
in this section, to find out what permissions you'll need to allow. To
learn more about setting Drupal permissions, go to the Drupal
documentation at [http://drupal.org](http://drupal.org).

Key Questions
-------------

Think about the online strategies you will use and consider these
questions before creating your petition:

-   Do you plan to send the petition via email?
-   Will you link to the petition on your website for people to sign?
-   Will you use other social media or offline strategies to drive
    people to your website to sign the petition?
-   How will you frame your message so that people will want to sign
    your petition?
-   What do you plan to do with the results from the petition?
-   What follow-up activities are you planning to continue communicating
    and building a relationship with petition signers?
