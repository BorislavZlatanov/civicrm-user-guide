The CiviCRM Community
=====================

Like many open source projects, CiviCRM is shaped, guided, and driven by
its community, a far-flung ecosystem of users, developers, and
implementers who utilize CiviCRM in many different ways and bring to it
a wide array of skills, experiences, and perspectives. These varied and
diverse offerings are crucial to the continued success of CiviCRM, but
they can move the project forward only if they find their way back into
the public stream of discussion and collaboration. This chapter is a
guide to finding and engaging in the community of people who are working
together to make CiviCRM what it is and what it will become.

Finding the Community Online
----------------------------

As might be expected of a web-based software project, much of the
CiviCRM community's activity occurs online. This means that if you have
access to the Internet you also have access to and can participate in
the CiviCRM community regardless of where you live or work. English is
the predominant language for discussion and contributions.

The CiviCRM website itself ([http://civicrm.org](http://civicrm.org)) is
a good starting point for exploring and participating in the community.
In addition to general information about getting and using CiviCRM,
you'll find blog posts from community members, announcements about
upcoming events, and a Participate section
([http://civicrm.org/participate](http://civicrm.org/participate)) that
lists and links to many of the resources described below.

The CiviCRM Stack Exchange site ([http://civicrm.stackexchange.com](http://civicrm.stackexchange.com/))
This is a fairly new site specfically designed for asking and answering questions about CiviCRM.  This is now the primary site for getting answers to questions on installing, upgrading, configuring, using and customizing CiviCRM.  

The CiviCRM Forums
[(](http://forum.civicrm.org)[http://forum.civicrm.org](http://forum.civicrm.org))
are a central location for CiviCRM discussion and support. The forums
are divided into topical boards for:

-   Asking general questions
-   Getting technical support for installing, upgrading, configuring,
    using, and customizing CiviCRM
-   Discussing and providing feedback on documentation
-   Feature requests and suggestions
-   Projects in internationalisation and localisation
-   Showcasing success stories and case studies
-   Conversations around modifying and extending CiviCRM
-   Coordination of testing
-   Obtaining or providing professional services

Registration for the forums is completely free and most of the boards
are very active with frequent new posts and responses.

Another great source of support and discussion is Internet Relay Chat
(IRC). The #civicrm IRC channel is hosted by Freenode at
[http://irc.civicrm.org/](http://irc.civicrm.org/) You can access the
channel using an IRC client (a program that you run on your computer) or
through the web interface at
[http://webchat.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net). Enter
\#civicrm in the Channels field and a nickname of your choosing in the
Nickname field. For more information on using IRC, check out the IRC
section of the Drupal website
([http://drupal.org/irc](http://drupal.org/irc)). Although the
information is targeted to the Drupal community it can also be useful
for CiviCRM users, especially because the Drupal IRC channels are also
hosted on Freenode.

You'll hopefully find that both the forums and the IRC channel are great
sources for help, support, and good ideas. That's all attributable to
the good will and generous efforts of people like you! Everyone who
visits the forums and the channel is encouraged to give back to the
community by responding to questions and requests for help and
contributing their own ideas and feedback to the conversations. And
simply asking your own questions is also a significant contribution to
the community. It's likely that someone else is having the same problems
or wondering the same thing, and the responses you solicit help build
the community's knowledge base.

The CiviCRM blog ([http://civicrm.org/blog](http://civicrm.org/blog)) is
another good source of information and discussion. Blog posts are
written by both the CiviCRM core team and other community members and
cover a wide range of topics, including general news and announcements,
upcoming events and accounts of events that have occurred, case studies,
use cases and ways to get things done with CiviCRM, and new features and
development. Comments are encouraged and can create lively discussions
that can in turn direct future CiviCRM development. If you've got
something that you'd like to post on the blog, we encourage you to write
to [info@civicrm.org](mailto:info@civicrm.org) with your ideas and your
request to post.

Much discussion of CiviCRM also occurs outside of these official
channels. Using your favorite engine to search for CiviCRM will turn up
many articles and posts from other folks' websites and blogs. The
CiviCRM team is good at keeping an eye out for these posts and often
publicize them through Twitter. To keep abreast of the stream of
comments, follow @civicrm and find CiviCRM tweets and tag your own
tweets with the #civicrm hashtag.

Finding the Community Offline
-----------------------------

Though the online community is both accessible and active, participating
in the CiviCRM community offline can be even more rewarding and can help
you connect with others in your area who are developing, implementing,
and using CiviCRM.

Many cities and regions hold CiviCRM meetups where people gather to
learn about CiviCRM, share new ideas, developments, and use cases, and
meet other folks involved with the community. You can find out more
about meetups at [http://civicrm.org](http://civicrm.org). Some meetup
and local user groups (or LUGs) also maintain discussion boards at
[http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php/board,73.0.html](http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php/board,73.0.html).
Contact the CiviCRM crew if you'd like a discussion board for your own
group on the site.

CiviCRM held the first CiviCon conference in April 2010 in San
Francisco. These have now settled into a pattern of two CiviCons per
year - one in the USA in April/May and one in London in
September/October. Stay tuned to CiviCRM.org for announcements of future
CiviCons.

CiviCRM core developers and community members also make appearances at
other conferences, including DrupalCon, the NonProfit Technology
Conference, Joomla! events, and Aspiration Tech events.

CiviCRM also conducts user and developer training in cities around the
globe. Check out [http://civicrm.org](http://civicrm.org) for info about
upcoming trainings and contact CiviCRM if you'd like to host trainings
in your own area.

Open Source = Community Sourced
-------------------------------

Here are some additional ways that you can participate in and contribute
to the CiviCRM community.

-   Contribute to CiviCRM documentation. This book was written by
    community members; you can contribute to it by going to
    [http://booki.flossmanuals.net/civicrm/_edit/](http://booki.flossmanuals.net/civicrm/_edit/),
    registering, and clicking "Edit this page" on the page you want to
    edit. You can also find and contribute to the CiviCRM documentation
    wiki at
    [http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/CiviCRM+Documentation](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/CiviCRM+Documentation).
-   Share use cases and case studies that describe how your organization
    uses CiviCRM and the solutions and processes you've developed around
    the software. You can post your case studies to the CiviCRM.org
    website by clicking **Add Case Study** from the Case Studies page:
    [http://civicrm.org/what/casestudies](http://civicrm.org/what/casestudies)
-   You can also share your successes, experiences at Civi-related
    events, interesting customizations, etc. on the CiviCRM.org blog:
    [http://civicrm.org/blog](http://civicrm.org/blog) 
-   Share your training resources and materials with the rest of the
    community through the wiki, the forums, or blog posts on the CiviCRM
    blog or your own sites.
-   Contribute code you've written to extend CiviCRM, because it's
    likely that someone else out there needs the same functionality.
    Check out the recommended steps for developing and contributing to
    the CiviCRM core codebase
    at [http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/x/kADNAQ](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/x/kADNAQ)[.](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Recommended+Steps+for+Developing+and+Contributing+to+CiviCRM+Core+Codebase.)
    If you've developed a Drupal module, you should contribute it to
    Drupal.org; see
    [http://drupal.org/node/7765](http://drupal.org/node/7765) for more
    information on contributing modules. Joomla! extensions can be
    posted on [http://forge.joomla.org/](http://forge.joomla.org).
    Finally, you can post your code on the CiviCRM Forums or wiki as
    attachments.
-   Sponsor development of new features. If your organization needs
    certain features or functionality that doesn't yet exist for CiviCRM
    and can't develop those features in-house, you can sponsor their
    development by outside coders and developers. This can be a solo
    effort on the part of one organization or a coordinated effort
    sponsored by multiple organizations in need of the same set of
    functionality. Refer to the wiki at
    [http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Developing+with+the+CiviCRM+team](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Developing+with+the+CiviCRM+team)
    or write to [info@civicrm.org](mailto:info@civicrm.org) for more
    information on sponsoring development.
-   Report any bugs that you find in CiviCRM. See the *Bug Reporting*
    chapter of this book for more information.
