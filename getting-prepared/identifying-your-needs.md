Identifying Your Needs
======================

This chapter covers some basic strategies for identifying your
organizational needs, and how they could be met by CiviCRM. It doesn't
go into detail about CiviCRM functionality or how CiviCRM stores data
(you will find that in other chapters). Instead, we encourage you to
first take a step back and think about your organisation.

Building internal support for a new Constituent Relationship Management
(CRM) solution is a complex task that, when done thoughtfully, can yield
great rewards.

Some organizations are comfortable appointing a team to do this
internally while others rely on outside consultants. Following are our
recommendations for how best to evaluate your organization’s needs and
build internal support.

Goal
----

To start with, take a minute to articulate the goal of adopting a CRM.
For example:

*Investing in our organization’s database of 12,000 constituents will
allow our team to better focus on raising funds and awareness to fulfill
our mission now and in the future.*

Evaluation
----------

Evaluate your organization's specific CRM needs by interviewing key
stakeholders. This might include development, communications, marketing,
events and programs staff as well as board members.

**Help them identify the constituents** they interact with on a routine
basis and to articulate key challenges in managing constituent
information (collecting, updating, sharing and using contact
information).

**Identify specific inefficiencies** that could be addressed by a
comprehensive Constituent Relationship Management solution.

**Enumerate the resulting lost productivity**. For example:

-   **Incoherent view of our constituents.** We are unable to see a
    holistic record of our constituents eg: who is a donor, volunteer
    and e-newsletter subscriber.
-   **Inability to include all prospective donors in all outreach
    efforts.** With fractured constituent lists we are unable to include
    all constituents in our efforts to raise funds, awareness and
    promote events.
-   **Inefficient use of staff.**Redundant staff time is spent re-keying
    information originally received digitally, importing, exporting and
    de-duping records.
-   **Lack of communication.**Inability to communicate across
    departments about our various interactions with the same
    constituent.
-   **Data vulnerability.**Inability to make reliable backups of all
    data and protect it against malicious or accidental loss.


**Lastly, inventory current data sources** that could be consolidated
and shared across departments. For example:

-   **Owner / Department / Count / Constituent / Description /
    filename**
-   Kris / Comms / 245 / short-lead media contacts / comms campaigns /
    comms2010.doc
-   Katie /Dev / 79,000 / donors / donors active since 2005 /
    donors2005-2010.xls
-   Martha /Marketing / 233 / corporate partners / active partners /
    (Outlook)
-   Dan /Marketing / 134 / grassroots partners / all grassroots partners
    / grasspartners05-10 (Google docs)
-   Carole / Volunteers / 3450 / volunteers / all MLK day volunteers,
    skills / mlk_volunteers_10.xls

Benefits
--------

Enumerate the specific benefits of investing in a holistic CRM solution.
For example:

-   **Accessible to the entire staff** from inside and outside the
    office (with granular permissions from entry level to super-users)
-   **Holistic record for each constituent** showing all their contact
    information and interactions with our organization.
-   **Dynamic creation of constituent groups** allowing us to create
    groups of constituents based on criteria such as ‘all donors of over
    $100 in Massachusetts’ or ‘all donors whose gifts have amounted to
    major gifts this year’
-   **Dynamic creation of top donor and other reports**
-   **Constituents' self-service creation and management** of their
    contact/contribution/subscription/activity records

Recommendations
---------------

In recommending your CRM solution enumerate and compare its features and
costs to other market solutions. Share case studies of other
organizations who use the recommended solution.

**Implementation costs -** Include a budget for implementation that
contemplates:

-   discovery and project management
-   data clean up, consolidation and migration
-   system configuration
-   post implementation training and documentation

**Maintenance costs** - Include a budget for ongoing maintenance that
contemplates:

-   pro-active server maintenance
-   incremental data backups
-   operating system and software upgrades
-   ongoing training
