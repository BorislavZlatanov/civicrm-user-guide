Is CiviCRM for You?
===================

This chapter will help you to decide whether CiviCRM is the right tool
for your organisation.

CiviCRM is powerful software and has the potential to help your
organisation reach its goals - but it won't be the right choice for
every organisation. Here are some ways that you can find out whether
CiviCRM is right for your organisation:

-   read the book! (you might be doing that right now)
-   identify your organisation needs
-   talk to others who use CiviCRM
-   talk to a CiviCRM consultant
-   play with a demonstration site
-   install a test database

Talking to others who use CiviCRM
---------------------------------

If you know of another organisation that uses CiviCRM, talk to them
about their experience. Obviously the more similar they are to your
organisation, the better. If you don't know anyone that is using
CiviCRM, contact a CiviCRM Ambassador
([https://civicrm.org/ambassadors](https://civicrm.org/ambassadors)),
have a look on the CiviCRM forums, at case studies on the community
site, or try your local non-profit technology mailing list.

The CiviCRM forums
([http://forum.civicrm.org](http://forum.civicrm.org)) have a few boards
for people who are new to CiviCRM, such as "Pre-installation Questions"
([http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php/board,5.0.html](http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php/board,5.0.html)).
Remember that the forums are staffed mainly by volunteers so you will
get a better response if you spend some time formulating an easily
answerable question. You can also search the forums and browse for
questions that others have asked. If you wish to ask questions or
contribute to the discussions you must register first.

Talking to CiviCRM Consultants
------------------------------

Another option to help you understand CiviCRM is to make use of a
professional. The CiviCRM website lists professional vendors and
consultants that can walk you through CiviCRM
([http://civicrm.org/providers](http://civicrm.org/providers)), and
there are many others; you may find a local website company who has
experience with CiviCRM. Consider hiring a consultant for a day to
discuss with you how CiviCRM could help your organisation.
