Annual Contribution Statements
==============================

Some organisations like to send one receipt at the end of the fiscal
year covering all tax-deductible donations made during that year.

CiviCRM allows you to do this as follows:

1.  Use **Find Contributions** or **Advanced Search** with **Display
    Results As** set to **Contributions** to display the relevant
    contributions.
2.  Â Select all records
3.  Choose the action **Thank-you Letters for Contributions**
4.  Choose to**Update thank-you dates for these contributions**or
    **Update receiptdates for these contributions**as appropriate**.**
5.  ****Set "Grouping in one letter based on" to **Contact.**
6.  **
