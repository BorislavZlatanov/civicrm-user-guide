Keyboard shortcuts
==================

If you are on a PC, many common activities can be done with keyboard
shortcuts (aka access keys rather than clicking through the navigation
menus. (Unfortunately, there are no keyboard shortcuts for Macs.) In
CiviCRM on-screen help, keyboard shortcuts are called Access Keys.
